Are tiktokers lying?,https://www.reddit.comhttps://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/18tperq/are_tiktokers_lying/,"I've gotten a lot of advice saying that the weight loss community on tiktok is pretty positive, especially if you share your journey. It's also free compared to the $200/month fitness classes I go too. I'm also being considered for Wegovy. I had to log my diet and exercise for 3 months to get approved. But my blood work came back as severely anemic so things are still up in the air
I'm almost 30 and Ive never used tiktok. But I see a lot of ""what I eat in a day as someone who lost 90lbs in 4 months no exercise no diet"" videos. And it's full of meals, Mac n cheese, snacks. And when comments point out there's no way you ate that much and lost weight, there's a ""you should always feed your body"" response.
And I get it. But, either these people or 8 feet tall or severely exaggerating. Most are healthy diets that could lead to weight loss but not to the extreme degree that they are claiming. 50lbs-100lbs down in months doesn't seem realistic, especially not with the meals they are showing.
Personally, I eat 1200 calories a day. I've lost 15lbs in 3 months. And I'm 4'10. So maybe my perspective is screwed on how much the average human should eat. But even if I eventually get weight loss medication, hundreds of lbs a month is still not realistic

My people deep in to weight loss how do you keep sane?,https://www.reddit.comhttps://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/18trimc/my_people_deep_in_to_weight_loss_how_do_you_keep/,"Hey I'm almost 14 months in to losing weight which sounds great on paper but it's been getting difficult mentally. When I started I knew I had a long way to go and could just put my head down and knew the work will get me there. As I'm coming up on my original goal of 185lbs I'm realizing I have a little more weight to lose than I thought. Probably another 30lbs til I stop looking like a chubby guy.
Weight loss slowed down, body dysmorphia has kicked in. The first 100lbs feels like it was just a warm up haha. How do you stay positive I'm trying my best not to let myself down I'm doing so well.

I was watching this exercise scientist (Renaissance Periodization) and his broad recommendation was to do 3 month cuts interspersed with 3 month diet breaks in order to avoid “diet fatigue.” You don’t need a 1:1 cut to maintenance ratio but I think he’s right. After just 6 months in a calorie deficit I felt as cranky as someone quitting cigarettes. Now that I’ve been at maintenance for a month and change I feel a lot better', ""I love this, I failed in so many diets in the last 2 years till I accidentally quit a diet and didn't put on weight afterwards. Now I basically go till I'm burnt out, maintain till I'm refreshed mentally and motivated, then go again. Really helps when you have a lot of weight to drop"", 'Thanks a lot. That is interesting I will consider a break. I had a maintenance break in July but not since, that could help me while I figure out my emotions. Thanks for the advice :)', 'OP, it took me three years to lose 80 pounds because I took a few breaks. Give yourself some relief!! It’s ok, if not recommended, to take a break ON MAINTENANCE. Pick a date to resume weight loss and stick to that date.\nCongrats on your epic success so far!!', 'Honestly, I was lucky enough to stumble across the podcast We Only Look Thin when I was feeling really worn out. I love listening to those two, and nearly every episode leaves me feeling inspired to keep going. I often find an excuse to go for a walk, or even walk instead of drive to run errands, because it means I get uninterrupted podcast time.\nSome other things that I’ve done in the last year when the fatigue kicks in: take a break and eat at maintenance for a week or two; completely change how I spent my calorie budget (I tend to eat a lot of the same things, so I’ve sat down and planned out meals / snacks that I wasn’t eating at all); find a few restaurants in the area with calories listed online and treat myself to takeout a bit more often, while still knowing I am sticking to my plans for the day; find a workout or two that I genuinely love: I started with just walking, experimented with a few niche fitness classes until I found the one I genuinely enjoyed participating in. Eventually added weight lifting, which has been its own adventure.\nSometimes I’ll just pick a date 3-4 weeks into the future and commit to sticking to my boring new habits until then. Then I can revisit the scale or my body measurements, rather than putting the pressure on those things daily or weekly.\nFinal suggestion, if you’re not going already, is therapy. My counselor is so great at changing my perspective on things and celebrating accomplishments (including and outside of weight loss / fitness).', ""Talking about podcasts, I really like Burn fat with your brain too. The name of the podcast is a little weird, but every episode pumps me up! It's not pro-CICO (but not openly against it), encourages intuition and navigating urges, I like their vibe. Earlier episodes are very keto-focused so don't start there, they say it themselves, but starting with 2022 and 2023 episodes is very helpful to keep the momentum going."", ""I keep sane by remembering that it is a never ending process. I guess that might upset some people, but it can also be comforting. I don't have to rush to achieve a specific weight because it doesn't end when we get there. Weight management is a lifestyle we live, so you are already at your end point. Just like weight lifting isn't about being able to bench 300 lbs specifically, it is about lifting weights every few days to grow stronger. It can be nice to have a target weight in mind, but it is the lifting week after week that is the real goal.\nYou are already at the healthier you goal because you are doing the thing. Now you have to settle in and enjoy this lifestyle so it will continue on for many years to come."", ""Ultimately, the goal here isn't the rock hard or attractive body. Ultimately, the goal here is the freedom from what was causing us to have obesity.\nUltimately, the question is: Have we achieved choice and freedom over our eating? Can we enjoy eating without losing control, practice mindful indulgence, and resist temptations when needed? Can we stay on track during tough times, learn from mistakes, and recover from setbacks? Are we maintaining a healthy weight? If so, we've likely reached a point of food freedom. We're no longer puppets to its whims, nor are we afraid of its siren call. The ideal state is one of mutual respect and balanced decision-making, where food enhances our lives without controlling them. The attainable state might not be THAT ideal, but be good enough that our food problems have weakened to become non-problems.\nThat freedom should result in a right weight for our body in the ability to chase some of those other goals better."", ""You're doing amazing, OP! It's normal to feel down during such a long journey. I suggest taking a break, focusing on self-compassion, and maybe even therapy. Keep going – you've got this!"", 'It genuinely helped me to listen to a podcast called We Only Look Thin. If you don\'t have positive words yourself, it\'s perfectly fine to outsource. I\'ve listened to encouraging books, podcasts, youtubers, just anything that picked me up. An idea I\'ve also found helpful is to keep momentum rolling so future me that feels better can grab the baton and take it further.\nTry to show yourself some compassion. We see ourselves in the mirror as we feel, not as we are. When I\'m feeling down on myself, I see every flaw. When I\'m feeling better, I can feel pretty in the same body I was in last week.\nIt may also be more achievable to try to appreciate your body in a neutral way than a positive way. For example, you might be able to feel appreciative of your body not hurting or not being out of breath or something that being 100 lbs lighter has improved your comfort. Like how spending a few weeks sick really shows you the difference of what comfort your body usually provides you with.\nThis might be a weird one for you, but it helps me show more self-compassion if I externalize the idea of my body sometimes. I will sometimes thank her (usually in my thoughts if I\'m not alone) for responding to my effort by getting leaner and stronger, for keeping me out of pain, for keeping me healthy, etc. For you, you might think ""The poor guy\'s doing his best for me, he\'s responded to my efforts by losing weight, he\'s doing me solids I can\'t even recognize until he\'s struggling. He deserves my thanks and my friendship, or at the very least, for me to stop standing here in the mirror picking him apart when he\'s trying his damnedest for me.""']"

But the one thing I’m 100% sure did the most for my mental health was the daily walking. It really cleared out a lot of the grey clouds in my head. Am I 100% free is depression? No. But I think 90% would be a good estimate. Just start walking, make it a non negotiable. I might just help you too. Just make sure to go in without expectations, because ‘oh it’s not working’ will have you give up faster. Again, make it a non negotiable. Every day you take x amount of steps. Treat it like it’s a second job. You can’t not show up. You’re doing your future self a huge favor by starting this habit. I’ve lost 66lbs so far and I feel lightyears better. Life really can get easier. I never thought this would be me. So if you ever feel like it can’t be you: it can. You gotta show up and do the work, and it’s gonna suck for a while.

Gained 5lbs over Christmas - little disappointed in myself,https://www.reddit.comhttps://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/18tmnue/gained_5lbs_over_christmas_little_disappointed_in/,"as above, a tad disappointed in myself, not because of the gain but because I feel as though I had little control and kept going back to the chocolate even now I’m trying not to.
My 70lb loss is now showing as a 65lb loss in my tracking apps and I find that so disconcerting, I know it’s so small, basically nothing, and one week is nothing in the scheme of things but I’m trying to get my thinking back on a healthy track, I’m great 99% of the time but some things make me double guess.
So I gained 5lbs over Christmas, I only didn’t track for Christmas Day and some chocolate on Christmas Eve. Christmas is hard when it comes to food, substances and lifestyle changes, especially this year for me as a parent with kids chocolate and treats everywhere. I’m a fairly crunchy mum, but I’m also trying not to give my son the food complexes I had growing up which threw me into ED which is a learning curve for sure. We had Christmas Eve sacks for the three kids, and boy that was a real test on my willpower and not over eating, I go between over or under eating, I’ve now learned moderation over the last 7-8 months, but I still have days that suck, and always have, extremely under eating and almost dying from anorexia to over eating to replace my substance addiction, because you know the saying “I’d rather be chunky than a junkie” rang true. Now I’m trying to find balance, and allow myself days like that for special occasions without going mad and eating every thing in sight. Problem is when I start I struggle to stop, I had to hide my sons Christmas Eve sack because it’s full of chocolate.

Despairing.",https://www.reddit.comhttps://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/18tk3hf/the_more_weight_i_lose_the_more_i_realise_how/,"I have been overweight or obese literally all my life. I was overweight in kindergarten, became obese in primary school, then puberty hit and I became self-conscious about my looks so I starved myself down to a just-about-overweight level and stayed there from approx. age 12 to 19. That is the slimmest and fittest I've ever been, at a BMI of approx. 27. Then as I went to uni and entered the workforce, I became increasingly sedentary and I no longer had access to healthy-ish school meals, so I gradually ballooned up to a BMI of 42 by the time I was 30.
Thanks to an improved diet (and, to an extent, to a more active lifestyle), I am now down to a BMI of 36. Up until now I was under the impression that due to my large frame and because I still looked pretty good at that weight, going down to a BMI of approx. 27, like I was in high school, would be more than enough as a final goal. But as I'm gradually educating myself and cutting through layers of fatlogic that were instilled in me since childhood, I currently believe that I should go down to a BMI of 22 for optimal health and appearance - a weight I have never ever been even close to. It feels unachievable and I'm despairing.
Before, I had these small, achievable interim goals that were motivating me, I was dreaming about how jaw-droppingly gorgeous I would be at my next interim goal of BMI 34, etc. but that is gone now. While I'm more sane about my weight now, I also feel that I have switched to an all-or-nothing mentality that's dangerous and demotivating.

I did my first diet in my teens and it opened up my eyes at how much of a pain in the ass just losing 10 lbs is. To reduce chances of regaining you also have to include diet breaks (phases at maintenance), which lengthen the overall time to lose but increase long-term success. When someone starts from a point of being 100 lbs overweight for example, they\'re looking at a multi-year journey. The person can try to speed it up by ""one-shotting"" their weight loss (0 diet breaks), but chances are they\'ll regain if they do that.

I stopped seeing my friends entirely and rarely going out. I mean I started gaining during covid times due to stress and didn’t want to go out anyway, but now it’s like damn I’m a hermit.
When I first lost weight, mentally I was so fucked off guys. I couldn’t see myself clearly in the mirror, I still saw myself as 300+ pounds. I got down to about 170 and plateaued for awhile. I hated myself so much, felt like I had no future in my career, and wasn’t doing what I wanted to be doing in my life. I was also struggling with my disabilities, I got diagnosed with fibromyalgia at my skinniest and I realized all of my health issues weren’t because I was fat.
I was going to the gym twice a week (pre-covid), working out at home, and was supposed to be the most healthiest I’ve ever been. But my body was failing me every day. So much fatigue, body pain, and stress.
Now years later, I’m back to my starting weight at around 350. Mentally, I’m doing so much better. I’m on antidepressants, got a CPAP, I quit my shitty job, quit nicotine, pursuing art and things I love, and met my loving boyfriend who I’m definitely going to marry someday.

I’m persuaded by her claims that we’d do well to listen to what our bodies are telling us, but I also believe we can’t always reliably discern between what we think we want in the moment vs. what may be best for us long term (which is true of many things in life, not just food!)","['https://www.reddit.com/user/StarsThrewDownSpears/', 'https://www.reddit.com/user/just_laugh/', 'https://www.reddit.com/user/funchords/']","['My food noise isn’t telling me to eat an entire block of chocolate for the health of my body.

Therapy helps with learning better coping strategies but literally nothing except these meds have ever actually made it better to the extent I can get healthy.\nIf anything, I can actually listen to my body’s “you are full” signals now.

It’s a hindrance.\nHer argument about “just listening” to what our bodies are telling us just feels so ignorant given the food environment we live in, which literally engineers foods to make them addictive. This drug frees people from those chains.\nOf course hunger is important to have. But it is not the same as food noise.

The environment is created, in part, to exploit how the human body and mind works.

I already get called a big guy because of my weight and maybe it's just an illusion because of my fat and that I wear baggy clothes, but people call me ""big guy"" in the sense that I'm strong looking and that I pack a lot of muscle.
The problem is that I don't want to be seen as bulky/overly-muscular, rather I just want a lean, athletic appearance (think of Patrick Bateman).
So therefore, is it a wise idea to do strength training while losing weight, or since I want to appear less bulky and am worried about being too muscular once I've lost all the weight, should I just focus on my diet and doing cardio exercises?

I’m at 75.4kg currently and there has definitely been a change in my body or shape, as people have commented on my weight loss including my whole family. But I’m still fat. I have lots of leg and thigh fat, a tad bit chest fat, and fat around my whole arms basically. Any advice? Is this normal to deal with or should I lose more weight?

People are often unaware that while you are in a calorie deficit, your body consumes your fat and muscle to sustain itself. Weight training helps reduce the lost muscle mass and encourages your body to burn fat instead. Your diet though is also important to this factor as your body will require an uptake in protein to maintain and grow your muscles. I believe muscle growth in itself will help in your overall appearance goal since as you lose weight, it will help fill in any excess skin that results in the absence of fat.\nIf you're comfortable with sharing your height and gender, I can give you more detail to my above answer as it will determine a healthy BMI range for you and I can better calculate how many grams of protein you should intake in a day to help encourage muscle retention and growth in your body.

If you're not totally sure, or your answer is a bit vague - get a food scale and download a calorie tracking app and log everything you eat and drink for a week. Don't try to make any changes or go on any fad diet, just be 100% honest with yourself about exactly what's going on to your body. Include drinks, sauces, condiments, cooking oil - everything. No judgements.\nI think you'll find, the simple act of logging your food will already lead to some weight loss, even without trying.\nAnyway, from there you can easily see where you can make small changes to reduce your calories"", ""You should expect not to stick to it, but instead plan how to notice that and get right back to what you want to be doing. Instead of perfection without deviation, we're working on making our deviations smaller, less frequent, and shorter in duration.\nSo, we know that we will fall off the wagon (as it were). Not really, because the whole wagon thing is a poor metaphor when thought of as part of this healthy-lifestyle change. We don't 'derail' either, there are no rails. Those are not great metaphors. We're not depending on a wagon or a rail, where falling or crashing would be a disaster and final.\nWe're more comparable to being on a roadtrip, where a wrong turn is just a wrong turn. We don't crash the car and light it afire and live there. We just make some corrective turns and keep going.\nCalories count, and logging/tracking is a very important skill to usefully see calories to guide our way; but what we're really working on here are repeating habits and adjusting our expectations around food. The good habits make the calorie thing easier and more sustainable.\nWhen we go 6 days and screw up on day 7, it doesn't erase 6 days of repeating good behaviors that we're trying to make into habits. We might have a calorie setback, but those 6/7 days are in the habit bank. We've had 6 days of seeing right-sized meals. And if we keep tracking through the wrong-turn, we'll learn something and do better during the next wrong turn (because that will happen too). Next time we 'fail' -- we'll 'fail better.'\nLife is not placid -- there are storms ahead. We won't handle them perfectly, but we don't have to. We just have to weather the storms and keep going.\nI’ve tried the most insane diets and it worked for awhile\nWe can begin this by accepting that temporary measures are only going to have temporary results. For that reason, we should rule out insane diets or anything that is not going to be sustainable over our lifetime.\nI do 1h of cardio daily (cycling, elliptical or walk/run on the treadmill)\nThat's quite a lot but if you enjoy it, keep doing it. It's not going to hurt our weight loss any. If it does anything at all, it helps with weight loss as long as it doesn't make us either hungrier or feel more deserving of extra food.\nThose that guide our fitness tell us that we should be getting between 150 and 300 weekly minutes of moderate exercise, or between 75 and 150 minutes of vigorous exercise, or an appropriate combination when we do both.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/quick_start_guide\nThat's the method to start. Follow that guide and that timing, using your regular and normal food, and using portion control as your main tool for change. In later weeks, use the data to figure out if any foods need to be adjusted. All foods can fit, but sometimes we have to juggle or learn a new way to make an old favorite."", ""If I had to guess, it sounds like you're trying to diet, but you're not actually in a deficit. Very common!\nStart by weighing and measuring everything you eat (food scale, measuring spoons) and make sure you're including things like tastes, nibbles, sauces, condiments, and beverages. Log it all, and compare it to your baseline calorie burn.\nBe skeptical of the calorie burn estimates from cardio; the machines at the gym are notorious for over-estimating. 100 cal per 1mi on the treadmill is a pretty good ballpark. If in doubt, eat back only half of the calorie burn estimate from cardio."", 'If you\'re failing, then the diet may just not be sustainable for you, so you may be a fish trying to fly and then feeling like a failure when you\'re not built for it.\nThere\'s a podcast I like called We Only Look Thin, but something that stuck with me about them was the idea that you want something you can sustain and be happy with the rest of your life. If you are treating it like a thing you\'re going to do until you reach the checkpoint then go back to your ""normal"" life, it\'s not a sustainable change.\nMaybe it\'s a matter of evaluating what you\'re going over on and finding a way to moderate it. One of the examples they gave is that one of the hosts, Catherine, loves bagels but has trouble moderating herself with them. She paired eating her favorite bagel with getting her haircut, so bagels are still in her diet regularly, they\'re just moderated by pairing it with a behavior she does infrequently.\nIt\'s hard to be specific not knowing where things become a challenge for you, but analyzing what your struggles with it are can help you get creative about a solution. If it\'s binge eating, maybe it\'s keeping trigger foods out of the house. If it\'s fast food, maybe it\'s finding a way to moderate it, or maybe it\'s adjusting the amount of times per week you\'re getting it or adjusting the order itself to be less calorie dense.

with 2024 coming up, i'm sure many of you have decided (like me) to lose weight for good in 2024. if you're anything like me, you keep making this resolution over and over, choosing mondays or birthdays or new years to start this journey, and then fall of the wagon after a couple of days.
well, as it happens, the new year starts on a monday - so that's twice as good of a starting date.
i'm looking for people who are committed to losing weight and keeping it off for good to join a support group. this group will focus heavily on quitting sugar and recovering from binge eating disorder along with weight loss. i have been in tons of groups like these and the problem is that they never stick around. so for this one, i'm specifically only looking for people who are fully committed and prepared to take this seriously. i want to build a network of dedicated people with specific rules and guidelines, daily check ins, and weekly online meetings. i believe that support groups are only effective through structure and actually getting to know each other - accountability, after all, only works if you give a shit about the people who are holding you accountable, and how could you give a shit about random usernames on your phone? similarly, i want to offer and receive genuine support from others who are as serious about bettering themselves as i am.

Weight gain over the holidays,https://www.reddit.comhttps://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/18tx0w4/weight_gain_over_the_holidays/,I was doing so well. I lost from 337 to 288. Then came thanksgiving. And drinking. Then my birthday. And drinking. Then came Christmas. And drinking. Along with tons of food in between. I have gained back up to 305. That’s 17 pounds. And it’s not water weight either. I went off track from November 10th to the 28th of December. I’m just now getting back on track. That’s like 50 days of binging! Does any one have any tips for getting back on track and how soon could I possibly lose the 17 pounds? I’m thinking a month or so. Because when I first started losing weight on 1200 I lost 20 in the first month then 15 in the following months so I lost almost 50 in 3 months. How do I stop saying I’ll start tomorrow? That’s given me 50 days of I’ll start tomorrow. It’s heart breaking all that progress wasted now I’ve only lost 32 pounds… I guess atleast I didn’t gain everything back right? I was thinking of doing a liquid fast til New Year’s Day to get back under 300. I’ve done those before and lost 2-3 pounds a day because I stayed under 800 calories. I know that’s not healthy but it would only be for 3 days. Then I can get back to doing 1200. But it’s like every day I try to get back on track then after dinner I say what’s one more day? And then I eat everything again.,['https://www.reddit.com/user/Dangerous-Muffin3663/'],"['Instead of saying you\'ll start tomorrow, commit to starting right now.\nNo one else can make that commitment for you. You need to decide to do it. It doesn\'t have to be the start of a new day, do it right now.\nWhen you ask yourself, ""what\'s one more day?"" What do you answer? Because it sounds like that\'s not only one more day of not meeting your goals, but even more extra days of being unhappy, having to work harder, and feeling bad. Start deciding to feel better. Right now.']"
beta blockers affect on metabolism and daily calorie expenditure?,https://www.reddit.comhttps://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/18ttl1d/beta_blockers_affect_on_metabolism_and_daily/,"I usually have a BMR of 3500 and this was the sweet spot for me to eat and maintain my weight. Since starting beta blockers (20mg propranolol 3x daily) I have noticed I am gaining weight simply eating at my prior maintenance. I measure and account for every calorie I put in my body so there is no error in my calculations or any other logical reason behind this sudden weight gain (no other medication, lifestyle or health changes)
it is obvious that beta blockers must have an observable affect considering they slow your heart down by a noticable ammount. but I cant for the life of me find any literature stating how much of an affect that these medications have on BMR. is there anyway someone with medical knowledge could quantify the percentage change in metabolism? are we looking at just a minor drop or a drastic change?","['https://www.reddit.com/user/H_is_for_Human/', 'https://www.reddit.com/user/Lisadazy/', 'https://www.reddit.com/user/dumbhenchguy/', 'https://www.reddit.com/user/99bottlesofbeertoday/', 'https://www.reddit.com/user/PrestigiousScreen115/', 'https://www.reddit.com/user/dumbhenchguy/']","['3500 is extremely high for a BMR.

I actually have a mild form of dysautonomia myself, I got tested and they observed that I had a noticable change in heart rate but the change was a few beats shy of meeting the required minimum for a POTS diagnosis\nI was actually prescribed the beta blockers to treat this so could very easily explain it, never thought that this could have been one of the reasons thank you for sharing your insight', 'Probably dose dependent if it exists. I know someone on BB who has not gained weight.', ""Talk to your doctor about it. I'm no expert, but looked into max heart rate calculators recently and most have an option to mark if one uses beta blocker.
